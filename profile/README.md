# Open-source in German manufacturing

[ALSADO](https://www.alsado.de) is a privately owned company, focussing on bringing open-source-software to German manufacturing, especially to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

We do that, by developing and supporting open-source-projects like [nanoPLM](https://github.com/alekssadowski95/nanoPLM) and [OpenRadioss-WebGUI](https://github.com/alekssadowski95/OpenRadioss-WebGUI).

As the first company worldwide, we also offer support for the open-source-CAD-software [FreeCAD](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD).

We are also very active in traditional and social media, spreading the word about open-source-software in manufacturing.
